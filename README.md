# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage to provide a consolidated platform to store information learned in the boot camp. There is a lot to keep track of across many topics, so an organized central note page is helpful.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Browse notes on web development topics by topic, scrolling through the sections. Open the console to see JavaScript at work, which currently will give you a randomly selected topic to study.
